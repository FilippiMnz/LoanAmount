You take a loan from a friend and need to calculate how much you will owe him after 6 months.
You are going to pay him back 10% of the remaining loan amount each month. 
Create a program that takes the loan amount as input, calculates and outputs the remaining amount after 6 months.

Sample Input:
20000

Sample Output:
10628

Here is the monthly payment schedule:
Month 1 
Payment: 10% of 20000 = 2000
Remaining amount: 18000
Month 2
Payment: 10% of 18000 = 1800
Remaining amount: 16200
Month 3:
Payment: 10% of 16200 = 1620
Remaining amount: 14580
Month 4:
Payment: 10% of 14580 = 1458
Remaining amount: 13122
Month 5: 
Payment: 10% of 13122 = 1313
Remaining amount: 11809
Month 6:
Payment: 10% of 11809 = 1181
Remaining amount: 10628
